	<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
	<p>
	I am a well rounded graphic designer and photographer with nearly a decade of experience working in corporate, studio and start-up environments. I have built a strong skill set in design that ranges across all aspects of print while maintaining a comprehensive understanding of web. My past and current positions have molded me into a knowledgeable and capable asset who has the ability to produce quality material at rapid speeds within tight timelines. My role has shifted over the years to encompass all points of the development and creative process, while maintaining a heavy emphasis on concept, quality and brand integrity. The ability to see the big picture as well as the small design details makes me a capable asset and a strong candidate for any challenge handed my way. <br>
